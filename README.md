Hello,

To run this notebook you will need to install the dependencies, particularly I like to use pip install for its simplicity, 
see how here (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) :
- Pandas **
- pymongo **
- dns **
- hashlib **
- matplot *
- seaborn *
**These modules are necessary to see the output data if you choose to run the code on your notebook.
*These modules are only for the visualization of a graph.

Run the project;
To run this project you can download the code and paste it on a jupyter notebook. Jupyter can be downloaded and installed by anaconda (my choice) or used directly on a browser. 
See how here: (https://jupyter.org/try)

See the output data;
After you have a way to run the code through jupyter, you can simply click the run button and the results with the output data will be show to you.

If you have no python installed and wish to use anaconda this tutorial is the way: https://paulovasconcellos.com.br/como-baixar-anaconda-31fd49c19bd8
